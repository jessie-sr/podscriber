Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jisoo, and I'm Crystal. So our topic today is quite topical because we do have some pretty major East Asian holidays coming up. But before we jump into all of that, I did have a funny story to share that happened to me kind of recently. A couple weeks ago, James and I had some free time this one day. So we were like, oh, let's go and hit a quick nine hole since we've been getting a little bit more into golf lately. We finished our nine hole, and I guess even the nine hole was kind of funny. So we basically went at like 5.30 p.m. ish on a weeknight. When we pulled up, we noticed that there were way more people than usual because this is like our local neighborhood golf course, and it's kind of like a country club, I guess.
